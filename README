To use:

Put at least one .xml in input.

Edit Epic.txt and GX.txt to use a much higher number than other users of the system (need to coordinate)

Set numEpic and numEach to 0.
Set numGX to the number of copies you would like to make
run makeNewGTO.py.

Your new xmls will be created in output, under a folder with a timestamp of the time you created them.

To use makeCancellation.py, replace the folder name with the folder you would like to use.
